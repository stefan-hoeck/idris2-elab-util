# A Tutorial on Elaborator Reflection in Idris 2

Idris 2 elaborator reflection provides programmers with a
powerful and clean toolkit for writing metaprograms.

This is a tutorial consisting of several loosely related
posts / articles about different aspects and techniques
available in elaborator reflection. It was written - and
is still being extended - in the
hope that others might find it useful. Have fun.
